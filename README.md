## for, while, do...while() Loop

1. 
Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number – ask him to input again. The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the input/enters an empty line. Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no need to implement a special handling for a non-numeric input in this task.

1. 
An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything except 1 and itself.In other  words, n > 1 is a prime if it can’t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided  without a remainder by 2, 3 and 4. Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n. For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7 .P.S. The code should work for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value.

1. 
For every loop, write down which values it shows, in your opinion. And then compare with the answer.Both loops alert same values or not?

The prefix form ++i: 
let i = 0;
while (++i < 5) alert( i );

The postfix form i++
let i = 0;
while (i++ < 5) alert( i );
